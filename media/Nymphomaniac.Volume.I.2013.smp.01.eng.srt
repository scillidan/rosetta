1
00:00:01,734 --> 00:00:03,515
- Good morning, sir. - Any calls?

2
00:00:03,802 --> 00:00:04,601
No sir.

3
00:00:11,258 --> 00:00:12,014
What have you done?

4
00:00:13,426 --> 00:00:14,981
Oh. I cleaned up.

5
00:00:15,676 --> 00:00:16,286
You cleaned up?

6
00:00:17,223 --> 00:00:19,270
It... it was quite messy and...

7
00:00:19,317 --> 00:00:20,630
- Liz? - Yes sir?

8
00:00:21,637 --> 00:00:22,426
She cleaned up.

9
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:25,646
I know... I didn't know, sir.

10
00:00:25,717 --> 00:00:27,779
- I was away from my desk. - Are you completely mad?

11
00:00:34,889 --> 00:00:36,365
What is the tea and pastry doing here?

12
00:00:37,497 --> 00:00:38,834
I thought that's what you wanted for breakfast.

13
00:00:38,859 --> 00:00:40,232
You thought? Mmm!

14
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:41,365
You're not supposed to think.

15
00:00:41,885 --> 00:00:42,953
I don't pay you to think, do I?

16
00:00:43,062 --> 00:00:43,851
This is a do-over.

17
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:45,382
- A do-over? - Right.

18
00:00:45,703 --> 00:00:48,070
Pick it up, take it outside

19
00:00:48,222 --> 00:00:48,929
and do it again.

20
00:01:02,349 --> 00:01:02,999
One moment.

21
00:01:12,374 --> 00:01:12,867
Come in.

22
00:01:16,447 --> 00:01:18,523
Would now be a good time for some tea and cake?

23
00:01:18,554 --> 00:01:19,382
Sure, why not.

24
00:01:22,764 --> 00:01:23,826
Where the fuck is my cake fork?

25
00:01:24,381 --> 00:01:25,006
Cake fork?

26
00:01:25,494 --> 00:01:26,951
- Right. - Well...

27
00:01:27,615 --> 00:01:29,053
I would've got you one, but it just..

28
00:01:29,677 --> 00:01:30,639
feels inappropriate.
