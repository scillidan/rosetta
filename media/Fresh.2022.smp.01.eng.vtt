00:00:02.666 --> 00:00:05.300
So I love hot sauce.

00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:07.633
I literally just put it on every single thing

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.866
I can find around the house sometimes. From pizza to chicken wings.

00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:14.933
Even though it gives me terrible acid reflux.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.733
It makes its way up to my throat

00:00:16.733 --> 00:00:18.533
and I literally feel like I'm gonna vomit.

00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:21.833
- So... - Oh, yeah. That, um, sucks.

00:00:21.933 --> 00:00:23.866
But I love it, so...

00:00:23.966 --> 00:00:25.833
- Yeah. - Yeah.

00:00:26.033 --> 00:00:28.800
Like, I love wasabi, but, um,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.933
Mexican spices would be too much for me.

00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:34.000
- Mmm. Yeah. I get that. - Yeah.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.500
Yeah.

00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:48.133
- What? - I had this crazy thought. I...

00:00:48.466 --> 00:00:52.500
I just feel like... the women in our parents' generation,

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.566
they just cared more about how they dressed

00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:58.733
and just, kind of, how they looked.

00:00:59.533 --> 00:01:01.166
They were more into femininity.

00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:02.733
You know what I mean?

00:01:02.833 --> 00:01:04.466
Like, nowadays, I feel like girls,

00:01:04.466 --> 00:01:07.566
they just wear oversized everything, like it's a blanket.

00:01:07.666 --> 00:01:09.700
Do you know what I mean? You know what I'm saying, right?

00:01:09.833 --> 00:01:13.933
It's like... 'Cause I think you would just look great in a dress.

00:01:14.333 --> 00:01:16.733
Not that you don't look good in a sweater,

00:01:16.933 --> 00:01:18.433
- but I mean, if you were... - You guys okay?

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.966
Uh, yeah. Um, pretty much done, actually. Thank you.

00:01:22.166 --> 00:01:24.700
Cool. Yeah, we'll just get this wrapped up then.

00:01:25.533 --> 00:01:27.033
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.233
Oh, did you bring cash?

00:01:29.433 --> 00:01:32.000
Yeah. You reminded me, so...

00:01:32.066 --> 00:01:35.200
My brother is coming into town.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.566
If it's cool, I'm just gonna snag these leftovers

00:01:37.666 --> 00:01:40.833
- and, uh, I guess I'll just let you leave... - Cool. No. Yeah.

00:01:40.966 --> 00:01:42.966
a couple bucks less on the tip.

00:01:43.033 --> 00:01:44.233
If that makes sense.

00:01:45.966 --> 00:01:48.433
Your scarf is dipping into the noodles.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.466
Oh, fuck! Shit!

00:01:52.666 --> 00:01:57.066
I love this scarf. Um... Excuse me? Excuse me.

00:01:57.233 --> 00:02:01.933
Quick, come. Hi, do you have sparkling water?

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.500
- Sparkling. - Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

00:02:03.633 --> 00:02:05.466
- Bubble. You know bubbles? - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:02:06.166 --> 00:02:07.666
And a lemon, please?

00:02:08.666 --> 00:02:10.333
I don't know if she understood what I said.

00:02:10.333 --> 00:02:11.433
I don't think she speaks English.

00:02:22.033 --> 00:02:24.433
That was, uh, that was fun.

00:02:25.233 --> 00:02:26.666
You're really cute.

00:02:26.933 --> 00:02:31.300
- Thank you. - Yeah. We should do this again sometime.

00:02:32.166 --> 00:02:36.333
Yeah, look, Chad, um... -Yeah.

00:02:36.433 --> 00:02:41.233
Oh. I... I don't think we're really a match. You know?

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.300
I was literally just being polite.

00:02:44.366 --> 00:02:46.533
You're not even my type, to be honest, so...

00:02:47.366 --> 00:02:51.466
- Okay. - Oh, that's funny? "Ha-ha, it's hilarious"? Yeah.

00:02:51.533 --> 00:02:54.433
Okay. Good luck finding a guy, you stuck-up bitch.

00:03:03.033 --> 00:03:05.466
What the fuck.
