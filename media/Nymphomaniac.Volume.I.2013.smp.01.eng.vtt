00:00:01.734 --> 00:00:03.515
- Good morning, sir. - Any calls?

00:00:03.802 --> 00:00:04.601
No sir.

00:00:11.258 --> 00:00:12.014
What have you done?

00:00:13.426 --> 00:00:14.981
Oh. I cleaned up.

00:00:15.676 --> 00:00:16.286
You cleaned up?

00:00:17.223 --> 00:00:19.270
It... it was quite messy and...

00:00:19.317 --> 00:00:20.630
- Liz? - Yes sir?

00:00:21.637 --> 00:00:22.426
She cleaned up.

00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:25.646
I know... I didn't know, sir.

00:00:25.717 --> 00:00:27.779
- I was away from my desk. - Are you completely mad?

00:00:34.889 --> 00:00:36.365
What is the tea and pastry doing here?

00:00:37.497 --> 00:00:38.834
I thought that's what you wanted for breakfast.

00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:40.232
You thought? Mmm!

00:00:40.416 --> 00:00:41.365
You're not supposed to think.

00:00:41.885 --> 00:00:42.953
I don't pay you to think, do I?

00:00:43.062 --> 00:00:43.851
This is a do-over.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.382
- A do-over? - Right.

00:00:45.703 --> 00:00:48.070
Pick it up, take it outside

00:00:48.222 --> 00:00:48.929
and do it again.

00:01:02.349 --> 00:01:02.999
One moment.

00:01:12.374 --> 00:01:12.867
Come in.

00:01:16.447 --> 00:01:18.523
Would now be a good time for some tea and cake?

00:01:18.554 --> 00:01:19.382
Sure, why not.

00:01:22.764 --> 00:01:23.826
Where the fuck is my cake fork?

00:01:24.381 --> 00:01:25.006
Cake fork?

00:01:25.494 --> 00:01:26.951
- Right. - Well...

00:01:27.615 --> 00:01:29.053
I would've got you one, but it just..

00:01:29.677 --> 00:01:30.639
feels inappropriate.
