1
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,923
look, "labes".

2
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:14,008
fall, collapse, ruin, destruction, plague,

3
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:18,119
pest, fault, shame, disgrace, dishonour.

4
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:21,727
but why?

5
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,798
why would a man play these little tricks?

6
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,045
because he's cruel?

7
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,717
or because he's unhappy?

8
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,812
mum always said he was a passive man.

9
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,474
but he isn't passive!

10
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:43,830
being passive is his strength, not his weakness.

11
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,182
you don't have a career lasting 40 years if you're not smart.

12
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:52,577
he was just an ordinary man...

13
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,131
who made a career from saying clever things.

14
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,157
he was ordinary-clever.

15
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,527
while mum is exactly what happened to her.

16
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:07,803
- mum fought for what she wanted! - she fought for what she didn't want.

17
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,003
and nearly died.

18
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,474
- where would they put all their stuff? - we'll throw it all away.

19
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,683
dad keeps all the crap he wrote when he was thirteen years old.

20
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,256
he's hardly Dante Alighieri, dammit!

21
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,511
he's a man who wrote nonsense for the radio, then tv, that's all.

22
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,991
there are things in this house you don't know about it.

23
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,266
- tell me. - i won't tell you, i'll show you.
