00:00:28.003 --> 00:00:30.450
Fruits of pale honey

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.457
Moons of paper

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:38.812
And a goldfinch sings in the orchard

00:00:42.365 --> 00:00:44.779
Father, strong reaper

00:00:45.905 --> 00:00:47.538
Mother, standing fountain

00:00:48.597 --> 00:00:53.008
Its seed is winter flower

00:00:57.704 --> 00:01:00.264
Long nights of gall

00:01:04.942 --> 00:01:08.410
And at the end, a dreary sunrise

00:01:14.632 --> 00:01:20.351
You can hear the birds singing over the pine forest

00:01:20.688 --> 00:01:25.605
The ears of wheat are golden bright The reaper sings

00:01:26.199 --> 00:01:30.819
The memories of a dark winter go with the strong wind

00:01:31.431 --> 00:01:36.177
You can hear a song on the lane The farmer goes back home

00:01:37.244 --> 00:01:41.793
You can hear a song on the lane

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.740
The farmer goes back home

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:52.284
You can hear a song on the lane

00:01:53.223 --> 00:01:57.550
The farmer goes back home

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:08.222
Southern winds arrive

00:02:08.882 --> 00:02:12.212
They bring whispers of a better time

00:02:12.578 --> 00:02:15.782
Southern winds arrive

00:02:16.201 --> 00:02:21.461
And to the rhythm the willows sing
