00:00:11.405 --> 00:00:12.265
Can't eat.

00:00:13.046 --> 00:00:14.937
- What's wrong? - I don't know, I can't eat!

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:17.590
If you don't know, I do.

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:20.625
Too many sleepers last night, that's what.

00:00:22.812 --> 00:00:23.810
Look who's talking.

00:00:24.218 --> 00:00:25.710
Maybe you ought to take a week off.

00:00:27.766 --> 00:00:29.069
Just stop everything.

00:00:31.547 --> 00:00:32.272
I'm serious.

00:00:32.641 --> 00:00:34.058
I'll talk to Elly when he gets back.

00:00:35.509 --> 00:00:38.299
- I couldn't do anything before then. - Elliot is back.

00:00:41.045 --> 00:00:44.828
He... called here for you while you were in the shower.

00:00:47.138 --> 00:00:47.908
You spoke to him?

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:49.861
Well, I couldn't help it, could I?

00:00:51.975 --> 00:00:54.984
I explained to him that you were staying here with me for a few days.

00:00:57.677 --> 00:00:58.522
How did he react?

00:01:00.643 --> 00:01:01.502
Civilised.

00:01:01.926 --> 00:01:05.163
He apologised... for the scene in the bar...

00:01:05.988 --> 00:01:09.406
... and I more or less... accepted his apology.

00:01:10.901 --> 00:01:11.772
Where are you going?

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.696
Leo's in town.

00:01:15.333 --> 00:01:16.750
I told you about Leo...

00:01:17.017 --> 00:01:18.256
... and my Georgia picture.

00:01:18.792 --> 00:01:19.997
We're close to a deal.

00:01:20.801 --> 00:01:23.156
Don't go. I want you to stay.

00:01:26.392 --> 00:01:27.280
Beverly,...

00:01:27.676 --> 00:01:28.591
... I can't.

00:01:29.203 --> 00:01:30.689
OK. Yeah.
