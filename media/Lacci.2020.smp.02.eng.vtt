00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.923
look, "labes".

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.008
fall, collapse, ruin, destruction, plague,

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.119
pest, fault, shame, disgrace, dishonour.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:21.727
but why?

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.798
why would a man play these little tricks?

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.045
because he's cruel?

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.717
or because he's unhappy?

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.812
mum always said he was a passive man.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.474
but he isn't passive!

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.830
being passive is his strength, not his weakness.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.182
you don't have a career lasting 40 years if you're not smart.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.577
he was just an ordinary man...

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.131
who made a career from saying clever things.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.157
he was ordinary-clever.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.527
while mum is exactly what happened to her.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.803
- mum fought for what she wanted! - she fought for what she didn't want.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.003
and nearly died.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.474
- where would they put all their stuff? - we'll throw it all away.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.683
dad keeps all the crap he wrote when he was thirteen years old.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.256
he's hardly Dante Alighieri, dammit!

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.511
he's a man who wrote nonsense for the radio, then tv, that's all.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.991
there are things in this house you don't know about it.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.266
- tell me. - i won't tell you, i'll show you.
