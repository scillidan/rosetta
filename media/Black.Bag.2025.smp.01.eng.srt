1
00:00:10,566 --> 00:00:12,700
If we could make this quick.

2
00:00:12,833 --> 00:00:14,866
- Shall we? - Be my guest.

3
00:00:23,533 --> 00:00:24,900
Is today Friday?

4
00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:26,366
Yes.

5
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:27,633
Do you reside in the United Kingdom?

6
00:00:27,766 --> 00:00:29,233
Yes.

7
00:00:29,366 --> 00:00:31,333
Is Frederick Alan Smalls your true legal name?

8
00:00:31,466 --> 00:00:32,766
Yes.

9
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,233
Did you masturbate this morning?

10
00:00:34,366 --> 00:00:35,866
Oh, good.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,033
The embarrassing personal questions start early.

12
00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:40,033
Yes or no whenever possible, please.

13
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:43,100
You know, I’ve been looking forward to this.

14
00:00:43,233 --> 00:00:45,666
Did you masturbate this morning?

15
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,200
No.

16
00:00:47,366 --> 00:00:48,600
Didn’t have time.

17
00:00:48,733 --> 00:00:49,966
Are you sitting down?

18
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,133
Yes.

19
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,600
Are the lights on in this room?

20
00:00:53,733 --> 00:00:55,300
Yes.

21
00:00:55,433 --> 00:00:58,433
Are you now in the City of Westminster?

22
00:00:58,566 --> 00:01:00,166
No.

23
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,733
Do you enjoy toast?

24
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,466
Very much.

25
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:06,433
Yes or no.

26
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:08,066
Yes.

27
00:01:09,133 --> 00:01:11,700
Have you ever physically assaulted a significant other

28
00:01:11,833 --> 00:01:13,100
during an argument?

29
00:01:13,233 --> 00:01:15,333
Girl, you know I have.

30
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,266
Again, yes or no.

31
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,400
Yes.

32
00:01:19,566 --> 00:01:21,466
Enthusiastically.

33
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,966
Do you wear contact lenses?

34
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,466
Yes.

35
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,766
Do you smoke cigarettes?

36
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,300
No.

37
00:01:27,433 --> 00:01:29,233
Are you seated at the moment?

38
00:01:29,366 --> 00:01:30,733
Yes.

39
00:01:30,866 --> 00:01:32,200
Is it morning or afternoon?

40
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:34,300
Afternoon. Can we go back to the EPQs?

41
00:01:34,433 --> 00:01:35,833
They’re more fun.

42
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,233
Is your mother’s name Quiana?

43
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:41,166
Yes.

44
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,933
When did you first become aware of Severus?

45
00:01:47,266 --> 00:01:48,600
What’s Severus?

46
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:56,100
Have you ever failed to support any child of yours?

47
00:01:56,233 --> 00:01:57,933
Uh...

48
00:01:58,066 --> 00:01:59,666
only emotionally.

49
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,933
Yes or no.

50
00:02:01,066 --> 00:02:02,733
Yes.

51
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,666
Were you resentful that I passed you over for the CI job?

52
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,066
- I’m fucking human. - Yes or no.

53
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,166
Were you resentful that I passed you over for the job?

54
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,133
Yes.

55
00:02:15,033 --> 00:02:17,900
Did you steal Severus as a means of getting even?

56
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,700
No.

57
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:23,833
When did you first become aware of Severus?

58
00:02:23,966 --> 00:02:26,266
About two months ago.

59
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,033
How did you become aware?

60
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:29,700
Professional restrictions prevent me

61
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:31,466
from answering the question.

62
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,866
How did you become aware?

63
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,533
Same answer.

64
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:36,666
Did a patient divulge the information to you?

65
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,866
Same answer.

66
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,300
Outside of war,

67
00:02:39,433 --> 00:02:42,133
have you ever killed another person?

68
00:02:42,266 --> 00:02:43,100
Define "war."

69
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:46,800
Declared or undeclared conflict between the United Kingdom

70
00:02:46,966 --> 00:02:50,366
and another country or non-state actor.

71
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,333
No.

72
00:02:52,466 --> 00:02:54,433
Outside of war, have you ever been

73
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,900
in a shooting, knifing or fight

74
00:02:57,033 --> 00:02:59,700
where someone was seriously injured?

75
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:01,500
Yes.

76
00:03:01,633 --> 00:03:02,700
Have you ever betrayed your country?

77
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:04,400
No.

78
00:03:06,533 --> 00:03:07,933
What is your relationship

79
00:03:08,066 --> 00:03:10,033
with Dr. Zoe Vaughan?

80
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,900
Patient and social acquaintance.

81
00:03:16,533 --> 00:03:18,833
Would you like to take a break?

82
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,266
I’m good.

83
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,500
Is your middle name Beatrice?

84
00:03:25,466 --> 00:03:26,500
No.

85
00:03:28,766 --> 00:03:31,366
Is your middle name Beatrice?

86
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,033
No.

87
00:03:40,533 --> 00:03:42,200
Please answer the question truthfully.

88
00:03:42,366 --> 00:03:44,200
Is your middle name Beatrice?

89
00:03:44,366 --> 00:03:45,833
Yeah.

90
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,433
Are you tightening your anal sphincter muscle right now?

91
00:03:51,566 --> 00:03:53,566
Yes.

92
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,966
Have you read Physiological Stress Response

93
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,800
and Polygraph Deception by Weymouth and Coombs?

94
00:03:58,933 --> 00:04:00,433
Cover to cover.

95
00:04:00,566 --> 00:04:01,933
Yes or no.

96
00:04:02,066 --> 00:04:03,600
Yes.

97
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,433
Will you please release your sphincter muscle?

98
00:04:08,733 --> 00:04:10,633
Sure thing, George.

99
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,766
Who asked you to plant the movie stub

100
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,066
in the wastebasket in my closet?

101
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,133
What?

102
00:04:17,266 --> 00:04:18,933
No one.

103
00:04:19,066 --> 00:04:20,633
How many people are you personally connected with

104
00:04:20,766 --> 00:04:22,100
who were aware of Severus?

105
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:26,800
That question is inappropriately operational.

106
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,666
How many people are you personally...

107
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,233
George, you’re CI. You know I can’t answer that.

108
00:04:31,366 --> 00:04:33,133
Did you steal Severus?

109
00:04:33,266 --> 00:04:34,466
No.

110
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,600
Did you steal Severus for money?

111
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,000
No.

112
00:04:38,133 --> 00:04:40,900
Did you steal Severus for ideology?

113
00:04:41,033 --> 00:04:42,633
What ideology?

114
00:04:42,766 --> 00:04:45,333
Did you steal Severus because of your ideology?

115
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:49,033
The question assumes I stole Severus.

116
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:52,300
True or false: There is no God.

117
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,200
False.

118
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:56,800
How many sexual partners

119
00:04:56,933 --> 00:04:58,866
have you had in the last three months?

120
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,600
Two.

121
00:05:03,233 --> 00:05:04,700
True or false:

122
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:06,100
The greater good outweighs

123
00:05:06,233 --> 00:05:08,400
immediate legal or ethical limits.

124
00:05:09,966 --> 00:05:12,233
Impossible to answer without specifics.

125
00:05:12,366 --> 00:05:14,500
Do you think you’re smarter than most people?

126
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,166
Georgie, I know I am.

127
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,500
Yes or no.

128
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:20,033
Yes.

129
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:21,533
Would you like to come for dinner

130
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:23,033
at our home tomorrow evening?

131
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:24,766
Huh?

132
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:28,366
I need your help individually to figure something out.

133
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,900
Can you come?

134
00:05:30,033 --> 00:05:32,700
Um...

135
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,166
Yeah, sure.

136
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,900
Well, I had so much fun last time.

137
00:05:37,066 --> 00:05:38,200
Yes or no.

138
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:39,900
Is this an order?

139
00:05:40,033 --> 00:05:41,500
We’ll expect you at 8:00.

140
00:05:46,033 --> 00:05:48,033
Wait, what the fuck did we just learn here?

141
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:49,500
See you tomorrow.
