00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.399
sorry, i have no money for delicacies.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.999
- do you like brawn? - picture it as something else.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.919
i always wondered what a holstein schnitzel is.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.479
first, floured veal is fried in butter.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.759
then you add two eggs and fry them as well.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.839
you then add capers and garnish with sardines in oil.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.239
then the smoked salmon is added.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.878
- beetroot and beans? - yes, those too.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.559
and croutons.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.319
sadly, that isn't served in this restaurant.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.199
the emergency ration.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.220
now i'd like to invite you to a digestive.
