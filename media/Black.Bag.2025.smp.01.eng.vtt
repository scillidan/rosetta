WEBVTT

00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:12.700
If we could make this quick.

00:00:12.833 --> 00:00:14.866
- Shall we? - Be my guest.

00:00:23.533 --> 00:00:24.900
Is today Friday?

00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:26.366
Yes.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.633
Do you reside in the United Kingdom?

00:00:27.766 --> 00:00:29.233
Yes.

00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:31.333
Is Frederick Alan Smalls your true legal name?

00:00:31.466 --> 00:00:32.766
Yes.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.233
Did you masturbate this morning?

00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:35.866
Oh, good.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.033
The embarrassing personal questions start early.

00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:40.033
Yes or no whenever possible, please.

00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:43.100
You know, I’ve been looking forward to this.

00:00:43.233 --> 00:00:45.666
Did you masturbate this morning?

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.200
No.

00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:48.600
Didn’t have time.

00:00:48.733 --> 00:00:49.966
Are you sitting down?

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.133
Yes.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.600
Are the lights on in this room?

00:00:53.733 --> 00:00:55.300
Yes.

00:00:55.433 --> 00:00:58.433
Are you now in the City of Westminster?

00:00:58.566 --> 00:01:00.166
No.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.733
Do you enjoy toast?

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.466
Very much.

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:06.433
Yes or no.

00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:08.066
Yes.

00:01:09.133 --> 00:01:11.700
Have you ever physically assaulted a significant other

00:01:11.833 --> 00:01:13.100
during an argument?

00:01:13.233 --> 00:01:15.333
Girl, you know I have.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.266
Again, yes or no.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.400
Yes.

00:01:19.566 --> 00:01:21.466
Enthusiastically.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.966
Do you wear contact lenses?

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.466
Yes.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.766
Do you smoke cigarettes?

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.300
No.

00:01:27.433 --> 00:01:29.233
Are you seated at the moment?

00:01:29.366 --> 00:01:30.733
Yes.

00:01:30.866 --> 00:01:32.200
Is it morning or afternoon?

00:01:32.333 --> 00:01:34.300
Afternoon. Can we go back to the EPQs?

00:01:34.433 --> 00:01:35.833
They’re more fun.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.233
Is your mother’s name Quiana?

00:01:39.266 --> 00:01:41.166
Yes.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.933
When did you first become aware of Severus?

00:01:47.266 --> 00:01:48.600
What’s Severus?

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.100
Have you ever failed to support any child of yours?

00:01:56.233 --> 00:01:57.933
Uh...

00:01:58.066 --> 00:01:59.666
only emotionally.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:00.933
Yes or no.

00:02:01.066 --> 00:02:02.733
Yes.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.666
Were you resentful that I passed you over for the CI job?

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.066
- I’m fucking human. - Yes or no.

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:11.166
Were you resentful that I passed you over for the job?

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.133
Yes.

00:02:15.033 --> 00:02:17.900
Did you steal Severus as a means of getting even?

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.700
No.

00:02:21.833 --> 00:02:23.833
When did you first become aware of Severus?

00:02:23.966 --> 00:02:26.266
About two months ago.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.033
How did you become aware?

00:02:28.166 --> 00:02:29.700
Professional restrictions prevent me

00:02:29.833 --> 00:02:31.466
from answering the question.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:32.866
How did you become aware?

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.533
Same answer.

00:02:34.666 --> 00:02:36.666
Did a patient divulge the information to you?

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:37.866
Same answer.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.300
Outside of war,

00:02:39.433 --> 00:02:42.133
have you ever killed another person?

00:02:42.266 --> 00:02:43.100
Define "war."

00:02:44.166 --> 00:02:46.800
Declared or undeclared conflict between the United Kingdom

00:02:46.966 --> 00:02:50.366
and another country or non-state actor.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.333
No.

00:02:52.466 --> 00:02:54.433
Outside of war, have you ever been

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.900
in a shooting, knifing or fight

00:02:57.033 --> 00:02:59.700
where someone was seriously injured?

00:02:59.833 --> 00:03:01.500
Yes.

00:03:01.633 --> 00:03:02.700
Have you ever betrayed your country?

00:03:02.833 --> 00:03:04.400
No.

00:03:06.533 --> 00:03:07.933
What is your relationship

00:03:08.066 --> 00:03:10.033
with Dr. Zoe Vaughan?

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.900
Patient and social acquaintance.

00:03:16.533 --> 00:03:18.833
Would you like to take a break?

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.266
I’m good.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.500
Is your middle name Beatrice?

00:03:25.466 --> 00:03:26.500
No.

00:03:28.766 --> 00:03:31.366
Is your middle name Beatrice?

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.033
No.

00:03:40.533 --> 00:03:42.200
Please answer the question truthfully.

00:03:42.366 --> 00:03:44.200
Is your middle name Beatrice?

00:03:44.366 --> 00:03:45.833
Yeah.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.433
Are you tightening your anal sphincter muscle right now?

00:03:51.566 --> 00:03:53.566
Yes.

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.966
Have you read Physiological Stress Response

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.800
and Polygraph Deception by Weymouth and Coombs?

00:03:58.933 --> 00:04:00.433
Cover to cover.

00:04:00.566 --> 00:04:01.933
Yes or no.

00:04:02.066 --> 00:04:03.600
Yes.

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.433
Will you please release your sphincter muscle?

00:04:08.733 --> 00:04:10.633
Sure thing, George.

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.766
Who asked you to plant the movie stub

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.066
in the wastebasket in my closet?

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.133
What?

00:04:17.266 --> 00:04:18.933
No one.

00:04:19.066 --> 00:04:20.633
How many people are you personally connected with

00:04:20.766 --> 00:04:22.100
who were aware of Severus?

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.800
That question is inappropriately operational.

00:04:26.933 --> 00:04:28.666
How many people are you personally...

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.233
George, you’re CI. You know I can’t answer that.

00:04:31.366 --> 00:04:33.133
Did you steal Severus?

00:04:33.266 --> 00:04:34.466
No.

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.600
Did you steal Severus for money?

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.000
No.

00:04:38.133 --> 00:04:40.900
Did you steal Severus for ideology?

00:04:41.033 --> 00:04:42.633
What ideology?

00:04:42.766 --> 00:04:45.333
Did you steal Severus because of your ideology?

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.033
The question assumes I stole Severus.

00:04:49.166 --> 00:04:52.300
True or false: There is no God.

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.200
False.

00:04:55.333 --> 00:04:56.800
How many sexual partners

00:04:56.933 --> 00:04:58.866
have you had in the last three months?

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.600
Two.

00:05:03.233 --> 00:05:04.700
True or false:

00:05:04.833 --> 00:05:06.100
The greater good outweighs

00:05:06.233 --> 00:05:08.400
immediate legal or ethical limits.

00:05:09.966 --> 00:05:12.233
Impossible to answer without specifics.

00:05:12.366 --> 00:05:14.500
Do you think you’re smarter than most people?

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.166
Georgie, I know I am.

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.500
Yes or no.

00:05:18.666 --> 00:05:20.033
Yes.

00:05:20.166 --> 00:05:21.533
Would you like to come for dinner

00:05:21.666 --> 00:05:23.033
at our home tomorrow evening?

00:05:23.166 --> 00:05:24.766
Huh?

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.366
I need your help individually to figure something out.

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:29.900
Can you come?

00:05:30.033 --> 00:05:32.700
Um...

00:05:32.833 --> 00:05:34.166
Yeah, sure.

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.900
Well, I had so much fun last time.

00:05:37.066 --> 00:05:38.200
Yes or no.

00:05:38.333 --> 00:05:39.900
Is this an order?

00:05:40.033 --> 00:05:41.500
We’ll expect you at 8:00.

00:05:46.033 --> 00:05:48.033
Wait, what the fuck did we just learn here?

00:05:48.166 --> 00:05:49.500
See you tomorrow.
