sorry, i have no money for delicacies.

00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,999
- do you like brawn? - picture it as something else.

3
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,919
i always wondered what a holstein schnitzel is.

4
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,479
first, floured veal is fried in butter.

5
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,759
then you add two eggs and fry them as well.

6
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:47,839
you then add capers and garnish with sardines in oil.

7
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,239
then the smoked salmon is added.

00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,878
- beetroot and beans? - yes, those too.

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,559
and croutons.

00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,319

11
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,199
the emergency ration.

00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,220
