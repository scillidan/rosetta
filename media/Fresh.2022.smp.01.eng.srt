1
00:00:02,666 --> 00:00:05,300
So I love hot sauce.

2
00:00:05,366 --> 00:00:07,633
I literally just put it on every single thing

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:11,866
I can find around the house sometimes. From pizza to chicken wings.

4
00:00:11,966 --> 00:00:14,933
Even though it gives me terrible acid reflux.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,733
It makes its way up to my throat

6
00:00:16,733 --> 00:00:18,533
and I literally feel like I'm gonna vomit.

7
00:00:19,166 --> 00:00:21,833
- So... - Oh, yeah. That, um, sucks.

8
00:00:21,933 --> 00:00:23,866
But I love it, so...

9
00:00:23,966 --> 00:00:25,833
- Yeah. - Yeah.

10
00:00:26,033 --> 00:00:28,800
Like, I love wasabi, but, um,

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,933
Mexican spices would be too much for me.

12
00:00:31,066 --> 00:00:34,000
- Mmm. Yeah. I get that. - Yeah.

13
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,500
Yeah.

14
00:00:43,966 --> 00:00:48,133
- What? - I had this crazy thought. I...

15
00:00:48,466 --> 00:00:52,500
I just feel like... the women in our parents' generation,

16
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:56,566
they just cared more about how they dressed

17
00:00:56,666 --> 00:00:58,733
and just, kind of, how they looked.

18
00:00:59,533 --> 00:01:01,166
They were more into femininity.

19
00:01:01,533 --> 00:01:02,733
You know what I mean?

20
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:04,466
Like, nowadays, I feel like girls,

21
00:01:04,466 --> 00:01:07,566
they just wear oversized everything, like it's a blanket.

22
00:01:07,666 --> 00:01:09,700
Do you know what I mean? You know what I'm saying, right?

23
00:01:09,833 --> 00:01:13,933
It's like... 'Cause I think you would just look great in a dress.

24
00:01:14,333 --> 00:01:16,733
Not that you don't look good in a sweater,

25
00:01:16,933 --> 00:01:18,433
- but I mean, if you were... - You guys okay?

26
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,966
Uh, yeah. Um, pretty much done, actually. Thank you.

27
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:24,700
Cool. Yeah, we'll just get this wrapped up then.

28
00:01:25,533 --> 00:01:27,033
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

29
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,233
Oh, did you bring cash?

30
00:01:29,433 --> 00:01:32,000
Yeah. You reminded me, so...

31
00:01:32,066 --> 00:01:35,200
My brother is coming into town.

32
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,566
If it's cool, I'm just gonna snag these leftovers

33
00:01:37,666 --> 00:01:40,833
- and, uh, I guess I'll just let you leave... - Cool. No. Yeah.

34
00:01:40,966 --> 00:01:42,966
a couple bucks less on the tip.

35
00:01:43,033 --> 00:01:44,233
If that makes sense.

36
00:01:45,966 --> 00:01:48,433
Your scarf is dipping into the noodles.

37
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,466
Oh, fuck! Shit!

38
00:01:52,666 --> 00:01:57,066
I love this scarf. Um... Excuse me? Excuse me.

39
00:01:57,233 --> 00:02:01,933
Quick, come. Hi, do you have sparkling water?

40
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,500
- Sparkling. - Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

41
00:02:03,633 --> 00:02:05,466
- Bubble. You know bubbles? - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

42
00:02:06,166 --> 00:02:07,666
And a lemon, please?

43
00:02:08,666 --> 00:02:10,333
I don't know if she understood what I said.

44
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:11,433
I don't think she speaks English.

45
00:02:22,033 --> 00:02:24,433
That was, uh, that was fun.

46
00:02:25,233 --> 00:02:26,666
You're really cute.

47
00:02:26,933 --> 00:02:31,300
- Thank you. - Yeah. We should do this again sometime.

48
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:36,333
Yeah, look, Chad, um... -Yeah.

49
00:02:36,433 --> 00:02:41,233
Oh. I... I don't think we're really a match. You know?

50
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,300
I was literally just being polite.

51
00:02:44,366 --> 00:02:46,533
You're not even my type, to be honest, so...

52
00:02:47,366 --> 00:02:51,466
- Okay. - Oh, that's funny? "Ha-ha, it's hilarious"? Yeah.

53
00:02:51,533 --> 00:02:54,433
Okay. Good luck finding a guy, you stuck-up bitch.

54
00:03:03,033 --> 00:03:05,466
What the fuck.
