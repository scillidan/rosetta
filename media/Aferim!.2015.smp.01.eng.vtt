WEBVTT

00:00:05.848 --> 00:00:07.933
Fucking bad luck! A priest in skirts.

00:00:08.808 --> 00:00:10.393
Ten years of misfortune.

00:00:13.563 --> 00:00:14.814
Away, Satan

00:00:14.982 --> 00:00:15.983
Why do we do that?

00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:18.610
'Cause devils flock around priests.

00:00:20.237 --> 00:00:23.406
What happened, honourable Father?

00:00:25.951 --> 00:00:28.954
This cursed wheel broke off.

00:00:29.121 --> 00:00:32.040
Shall we help, like good Samaritans?

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.044
God bless you. The snakes would have swallowed me alive.

00:00:36.128 --> 00:00:39.631
God is glad to see two poor souls helping each other.

00:00:40.007 --> 00:00:43.385
You have an axe there and all you need.

00:00:49.724 --> 00:00:51.184
What are you looking for?

00:00:51.393 --> 00:00:54.229
A runaway Gypsy slave who stole the boyar's money.

00:00:54.562 --> 00:00:56.398
Damned crow!

00:00:57.024 --> 00:00:59.526
I didn't see anyone. So he ran away?

00:00:59.651 --> 00:01:03.113
Yes, Father. The crows have no shame anymore.

00:01:03.196 --> 00:01:04.697
It'll be the end of us

00:01:04.781 --> 00:01:08.076
when the ass gets at the head and the cunt is in command...

00:01:08.118 --> 00:01:09.494
True, Father.

00:01:09.744 --> 00:01:12.122
I just hope he doesn't run to the Turks.

00:01:12.205 --> 00:01:13.415
What could he do there?

00:01:13.498 --> 00:01:17.419
He could become a mercenary in Nicopolis.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.712
If he does, we've lost him...

00:01:20.838 --> 00:01:22.090
Ready, Father.

00:01:23.758 --> 00:01:26.636
God, bless Thy servants, amen!

00:01:27.637 --> 00:01:29.139
Have some holy water.

00:01:29.597 --> 00:01:33.726
To wash us of our many sins...

00:01:34.019 --> 00:01:35.395
Good for you.

00:01:35.437 --> 00:01:37.730
As the Ecclesiastes says:

00:01:37.772 --> 00:01:41.902
"Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do,do it with thy might;

00:01:42.152 --> 00:01:44.154
for there is no work

00:01:44.279 --> 00:01:45.322
nor device,nor knowledge, nor wisdom,

00:01:45.447 --> 00:01:47.449
in the grave, where thou goest."

00:01:47.657 --> 00:01:52.495
Well said, my sons! Christ did not rise in vain.

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:53.746
So help us God!

00:01:57.334 --> 00:01:59.752
I'll spend the night at Manjoala's inn.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.048
I never travel in the dark for fear of outlaws.

00:02:03.298 --> 00:02:06.134
As for us,first business, then pleasure:

00:02:06.343 --> 00:02:12.099
we'll search 'til the Seven Sisters rise...

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:19.982
Isn't there a holiday coming, Father?

00:02:20.315 --> 00:02:22.067
So it is.

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:25.778
Forgive me, Lord! I hanged You with thread,

00:02:25.863 --> 00:02:30.575
and not with a gold chain, like the bishops.

00:02:31.952 --> 00:02:35.914
But isn't it faith that matters most?

00:02:35.998 --> 00:02:38.541
Faith, but also deeds!

00:02:41.503 --> 00:02:43.588
Another question, if we may?

00:02:43.671 --> 00:02:44.631
Sure.

00:02:45.257 --> 00:02:48.760
You're more enlightened, you have praxis...

00:02:48.844 --> 00:02:49.552
Sure.

00:02:49.636 --> 00:02:55.392
Gypsies, is they people or Satan's spawn?

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.144
Some say they ain't human.

00:02:57.352 --> 00:02:58.896
Human like us.

00:02:58.979 --> 00:03:01.314
Aren't they Christians?

00:03:01.648 --> 00:03:04.776
I myself baptised two slave cubs recently.

00:03:04.985 --> 00:03:06.069
Monastery slaves?

00:03:06.153 --> 00:03:07.820
Right, two chickies.

00:03:08.821 --> 00:03:12.910
Crows are descendants of Ham,son of Noah,

00:03:13.576 --> 00:03:15.913
cursed by his father to be black.

00:03:16.121 --> 00:03:19.291
They came here from Egypt.

00:03:19.707 --> 00:03:21.626
They are Egyptians.

00:03:21.793 --> 00:03:22.878
Is that so?

00:03:22.961 --> 00:03:25.588
Yes. What do we call crows to mock them?

00:03:25.672 --> 00:03:27.090
Black crows.

00:03:27.132 --> 00:03:29.426
There are no white crows. How else?

00:03:29.676 --> 00:03:31.178
Maggots.

00:03:31.386 --> 00:03:33.055
- What else?  - Darkies.

00:03:33.138 --> 00:03:34.306
Pharaohs.

00:03:34.431 --> 00:03:36.558
Good, aferim! Pharaohs

00:03:36.641 --> 00:03:40.979
'Cause they came here from Egypt,

00:03:41.104 --> 00:03:45.108
where they were also slaves,building palaces for the kings.

00:03:45.984 --> 00:03:49.821
When a wise man opens his mouth, open your ears!

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.325
Gypsies is humans.Jews ain't.

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:54.284
They's beasts.

00:03:54.367 --> 00:03:55.743
If you say so...

00:03:56.119 --> 00:04:01.416
Now you tell me,why is Jews not human?

00:04:01.541 --> 00:04:03.919
'Cause Jews drinks the blood of Christian children.

00:04:04.002 --> 00:04:05.670
The priest told us so in church.

00:04:05.795 --> 00:04:10.133
And why do they?

00:04:10.175 --> 00:04:11.218
We don't know.

00:04:11.426 --> 00:04:13.470
Have you heard of the Giant Jews?

00:04:13.595 --> 00:04:14.429
No.

00:04:14.512 --> 00:04:16.890
Shame on you...

00:04:17.015 --> 00:04:22.855
Before making mankind,God created the Giant Jews.

00:04:22.938 --> 00:04:24.940
Mean, ugly giants.

00:04:25.148 --> 00:04:29.277
He saw His mistake and turned them into dust.

00:04:29.527 --> 00:04:34.241
He left just a few,then made Adam and Eve.

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:40.622
The Giant Jews multiplied,but grew ever smaller.

00:04:40.914 --> 00:04:43.876
They's our Jews nowadays.

00:04:43.959 --> 00:04:45.335
We didn't know that.

00:04:45.502 --> 00:04:48.380
That's why Jews can't stand us Christians,

00:04:48.588 --> 00:04:50.966
that's why they killed Christ.

00:04:51.049 --> 00:04:52.550
And that's why I can't stand them.

00:04:52.634 --> 00:04:54.719
Do you know what I do with pork-haters?

00:04:54.802 --> 00:04:55.470
We don't.

00:04:55.553 --> 00:04:58.556
I cut off their beards and sidelocks.

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.393
Better a Jew without a beard than a beard without a Jew!

00:05:01.476 --> 00:05:03.228
Do you know what they do in Moldova?

00:05:03.311 --> 00:05:04.980
I don't know...

00:05:05.063 --> 00:05:10.318
Jews walk around in their carriages.

00:05:10.402 --> 00:05:12.404
And instead of horses

00:05:12.487 --> 00:05:15.908
they use good Christians.

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:18.911
I don't believe it, father.That's what the Russians did to us.

00:05:18.952 --> 00:05:20.578
In the war of 1828,

00:05:20.662 --> 00:05:23.081
General Zaltukhin harnessed our peasants...

00:05:23.165 --> 00:05:26.001
The Christians in my cousin's village

00:05:26.126 --> 00:05:28.670
can't bleed themselves

00:05:28.795 --> 00:05:32.090
the Jews left no leeches in the lake.

00:05:32.132 --> 00:05:37.179
But some Jews are baptised into our Christian faith.

00:05:37.304 --> 00:05:39.014
Who would believe those outlaws?

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:41.099
"Who makes up the Devil's flocks? "

00:05:41.183 --> 00:05:43.226
"All the Jews with their sidelocks."

00:05:43.422 --> 00:05:46.050
Each nation has its purpose.

00:05:46.341 --> 00:05:48.802
The Jews, to cheat

00:05:48.886 --> 00:05:50.387
the Turks, to do harm,

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:53.182
us Romanians to love, honour

00:05:53.307 --> 00:05:54.934
and suffer like good Christians.

00:05:55.017 --> 00:05:56.810
And each has their habits.

00:05:56.936 --> 00:05:58.854
Hebrews reads a lot

00:05:58.938 --> 00:06:00.314
Greeks talks a lot,

00:06:00.397 --> 00:06:01.565
Turks has many wives,

00:06:01.648 --> 00:06:03.150
Arabs has many teeth,

00:06:03.233 --> 00:06:04.693
Germans smokes a lot

00:06:04.776 --> 00:06:06.070
Hungarians eats a lot

00:06:06.153 --> 00:06:09.156
Russians drinks a lot,English thinks a lot,

00:06:09.198 --> 00:06:12.952
French like fashion a lot,Armenians are lazy,

00:06:13.035 --> 00:06:15.537
Circasians wears many a lace,

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:18.916
Italians lies a lot,

00:06:18.999 --> 00:06:20.500
Serbians cheats a lot.

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.586
and Gypsies get many a beating

00:06:22.794 --> 00:06:24.463
Gypsies must be slaves.

00:06:24.546 --> 00:06:27.674
When Ham spread horse shit on Noah,

00:06:27.757 --> 00:06:29.051
Noah cursed them to be slaves

00:06:29.176 --> 00:06:30.135
and as dark as shit.

00:06:30.219 --> 00:06:31.178
That's right.

00:06:31.595 --> 00:06:35.099
They must be kept on a tight leash.'Tis a holy commandment.

00:06:35.182 --> 00:06:39.311
But with kindness.That is my habit.

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:42.314
Though I'm as harsh as a hot pepper

00:06:42.397 --> 00:06:45.067
born of father Garlic and mother Onion.

00:06:46.485 --> 00:06:49.321
I treat people kindly.

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:53.033
The Gospel says to be as gentle as doves, Father...

00:06:53.117 --> 00:06:56.871
If the beasts weren't vanquished,

00:06:56.996 --> 00:06:59.289
they would tear man apart.

00:06:59.373 --> 00:07:02.626
Even among people,most are beasts

00:07:02.709 --> 00:07:06.671
who must be tamed to make them work.

00:07:06.755 --> 00:07:08.507
Particularly the crows.

00:07:09.008 --> 00:07:10.634
Lovely thoughts, Father.

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:20.560
We'll head this way.

00:07:22.604 --> 00:07:24.189
We wish you good health.

00:07:24.773 --> 00:07:27.526
Good health to bear good grief.

00:07:27.526 --> 00:07:29.694
Go with God, we may meet again.

00:07:29.778 --> 00:07:32.072
The mountains themselves sometimes meet...

00:07:32.865 --> 00:07:35.034
True words.
